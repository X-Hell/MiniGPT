"This must be a magic stone!" Emma thought. She put it in her pocket and made a wish.

"I wish I could fly like a bird," she whispered.

Emma waited, but nothing happened. She felt a little disappointed.

Her grandma saw her sad face. "What's wrong, dear?" she asked.

Emma showed her the stone. "I wished I could fly, but it didn't work."

Grandma smiled. "Magic is everywhere, Emma. But some wishes take time. And some magic is already inside you."

She ran around the yard with her arms out wide. "I'm flying! I'm really flying!" she laughed.

Mia loved the rain. When it rained, she would put on her yellow boots and go outside.

Splash! Splash! She jumped in every puddle she could find.

One rainy day, Mia saw a rainbow in the sky. It had so many colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

"I want to find where the rainbow ends," Mia said.

She walked and walked, following the rainbow. But no matter how far she went, the rainbow seemed just as far away.

Mia sat down, feeling tired. Then she smiled. "Maybe the rainbow isn't about the end," she thought. "Maybe it's about enjoying the colors."

Mia loved the rain. When it rained, she would put on her yellow boots and go outside.

Splash! Splash! She jumped in every puddle she could find.

One rainy day, Mia saw a rainbow in the sky. It had so many colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

"I want to find where the rainbow ends," Mia said.

She walked and walked, following the rainbow. But no matter how far she went, the rainbow seemed just as far away.

Mia sat down, feeling tired. Then she smiled. "Maybe the rainbow isn't about the end," she thought. "Maybe it's about enjoying the colors."

Mia loved the rain. When it rained, she would put on her yellow boots and go outside.

Splash! Splash! She jumped in every puddle she could find.

One rainy day, Mia saw a rainbow in the sky. It had so many colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

"I want to find where the rainbow ends," Mia said.

She walked and walked, following the rainbow. But no matter how far she went, the rainbow seemed just as far away.

Mia sat down, feeling tired. Then she smiled. "Maybe the rainbow isn't about the end," she thought. "Maybe it's about enjoying the colors."

But then, Whiskers realized he didn't know how to get home. He felt scared.

Whiskers sat down and meowed loudly. A friendly cow heard him.

"Are you lost, little cat?" the cow asked.

"Yes," Whiskers said sadly.

"Follow me," said the cow. "I'll take you back to the farm."

The cow led Whiskers back to the fence. Whiskers squeezed through the hole and was home!

"Thank you!" Whiskers called to the cow. He learned that it's good to explore, but it's also important to remember your way home.

Splash! Splash! She jumped in every puddle she could find.

Sara had a pet fish named Goldie. Goldie lived in a round glass bowl on Sara's desk. Sara loved to watch Goldie swim in circles.

Every morning, Sara fed Goldie tiny flakes of food. "Good morning, Goldie!" she would say.

One day, Sara noticed Goldie looked sad. He wasn't swimming as fast as before.

"What's wrong, Goldie?" Sara asked, worried.

Sara's dad saw the problem. "Goldie needs a bigger home," he said. "Let's get him a nice big tank."

They went to the pet store and bought a big glass tank. It had colorful rocks and a small castle inside.

When they put Goldie in his new home, he swam around happily. He even swam through the little castle!

"Goldie is happy now!" Sara said with a smile.

Emma found a shiny stone in her backyard. It was smooth and sparkled in the light.

"This must be a magic stone!" Emma thought. She put it in her pocket and made a wish.

"I wish I could fly like a bird," she whispered.

Emma waited, but nothing happened. She felt a little disappointed.

Her grandma saw her sad face. "What's wrong, dear?" she asked.

Emma showed her the stone. "I wished I could fly, but it didn't work."

Grandma smiled. "Magic is everywhere, Emma. But some wishes take time. And some magic is already inside you."

Emma thought about this. She realized she could use her imagination to feel like she was flying.

She ran around the yard with her arms out wide. "I'm flying! I'm really flying!" she laughed.

Emma learned that the best magic comes from within.

Jake was scared of the dark. Every night, he asked his mom to leave the light on.

"There might be monsters under my bed," Jake said.

They looked under the bed. There were no monsters, just dust bunnies and a lost sock.

"See? Nothing scary," Mom said.

But Jake was still worried. His mom had an idea. She gave him a small flashlight.

"This is your magic flashlight," she said. "It will keep all the scary things away."

That night, Jake held his flashlight tight. Whenever he heard a sound, he turned it on. The light made him feel brave.

Soon, Jake wasn't scared anymore. He learned that being brave means facing your fears.

Mia loved the rain. When it rained, she would put on her yellow boots and go outside.

Splash! Splash! She jumped in every puddle she could find.

One rainy day, Mia saw a rainbow in the sky. It had so many colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

"I want to find where the rainbow ends," Mia said.

She walked and walked, following the rainbow. But no matter how far she went, the rainbow seemed just as far away.

Mia sat down, feeling tired. Then she smiled. "Maybe the rainbow isn't about the end," she thought. "Maybe it's about enjoying the colors."

Mia looked up at the beautiful rainbow and felt happy. Sometimes the journey is better than the destination.

Butterflies danced around him. Birds sang in the trees. It was like a whole new world!

But then, Whiskers realized he didn't know how to get home. He felt scared.
